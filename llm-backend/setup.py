LLM Backend Setup Script

This is the standard setup script for the LLM backend application.
It leverages setuptools to handle package installation and dependencies.

The actual package configuration is defined in the pyproject.toml or setup.cfg
file, following modern Python packaging practices. This script simply serves
as an entry point for the setup process.

To install the package:
    python setup.py install

For development installation:
    python setup.py develop
"""

from setuptools import setup

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup()
